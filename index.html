        <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Jake. I'm a systems administrator that is looking to break into the DevOps
            world.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will use this site to document my journey and it will eventually serve as both a blog
            and resume of sorts.
        </p>
        <p>
            As it stands, the site is hosted on GCP using a Cloud Storage bucket. Of course, there isn't 
            much to see yet, but that will change as the project moves forward.
        </p>
        <p>Things to do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make the site actually look good</li>
            <li>Integrate a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub</li>
            <li>Create a blog portion</li>
            <li>Integrate a visitor counter</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This site and the idea behind it are loosely based on the "Cloud Resume Project"
        </p>
